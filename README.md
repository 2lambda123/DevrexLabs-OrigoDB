OrigoDB in-memory database engine
=======

## Build faster systems, faster
Accessing data from RAM is orders of magnitude faster than reading from disk. 
Also, data in RAM can be in a native format eliminating the need for object/relational
mapping or other translation, significantly reducing developer time and cost.

With OrigoDB, you write an in-memory data model, commands and queries using a NET language of your choice. 
The engine is 100% ACID, taking care of persisting transactions and synchronizing access to the in-memory model from
multiple threads.
